## Getting Started
Imagine you're working on a web browser interface similar to Chrome, where multiple tabs can be opened, but only one tab's content is visible at a time. Your task is to create a Tabs Component that mimics this behavior.

Each tab in a browser represents a webpage, and only the currently active tab's content (webpage) is displayed. Users can switch between tabs, and the corresponding content should update accordingly.

You're given a minimal app setup, but the Tabs component is incomplete. You'll need to write the logic to manage the active tab and conditionally display the right content panel.

## Requirements
1. *Tab Navigation:* Create multiple tab elements that can be clicked, just like switching between different web pages in a browser.
2. *Content Display:* Display only the content of the currently active tab while hiding the content of inactive tabs.
3. *Active Tab Indication:* Visually indicate the currently active tab.
4. *Initial Tab Selection:* The parent component should be able to set an initialSelectedTab, and the Tabs component must respect that selection, setting the correct tab as active when the component first renders.

## Submission Instructions
1. Clicking "Run code" will compile and run your code against sample tests, but it will not generate scores. Click on "Execution Log" to better understand the test execution.
2. Clicking "Submit code" will run your code against multiple test cases, assessing different scenarios holistically. The score will be assigned accordingly.

To access the instructions, click on the "Question" button which can be found in the bottom left corner of the screen.
