    The component should take in two props: 
    1. initialSelectedTabId (string): This prop specifies the ID of the tab that should be active when the component first renders.
    2. children: The content that represents each tab's content area. It should display the content of the currently active tab while hiding others.
    
    Your task is to render all the tab names and ensure that only the content of the active/selected tab is visible.
    Make sure the tab indicated by initialSelectedTabId is selected on the initial render.
